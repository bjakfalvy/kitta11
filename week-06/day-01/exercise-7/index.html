          the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which maintained law
          and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue,
          Minipax, Miniluv and Miniplenty.</div>
