Tell me what I've gotta do
There's no getting through to you
The lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)
You say I can't understand
But you're not giving me a chance
When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?)
All the walls that you keep building
All this time that I spent chasing
All the ways that I keep losing you
